# nodejs-task-2

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of various patterns and modules in JavaScript. It includes three main components:

1. `question-1.txt`: An explanation of the Reactor Pattern, Callback Pattern, and Module System.
2. `question-2.js`: A JavaScript script that utilizes the `async.mapSeries` function to perform asynchronous operations on an array of numbers.
3. `question-3.js`: A JavaScript script that demonstrates file and folder copying using the Node.js `fs`, `streams`, and `path` modules.
